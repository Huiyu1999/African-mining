## Mining Mine - A Computer Vision Approach  
---
#### Overview  
In addition to inferring mining activities by analysing tabular data, we are also curious about whether the image data can be useful for making more accurate decisions. With this motivation, we plan to apply **Computer Vision** to the mining inference process.  
Here is the steps:  
1. Raw Image Data Collection from [Google Earth Pro](https://earth.google.com/web).  **On Going⏳**  
2. Data Processing & Data Analysis.  **TODO⛳️**  
3. Model Exploration.  **TODO⛳️**  
4. Fine Tuning.  **TODO⛳️**  
5. Evaluation.  **TODO⛳️**
